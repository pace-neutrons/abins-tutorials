# Abins Tutorials

Some advanced demonstrations of inelastic neutron scattering simulations with AbINS. While the Abins Mantid algorithms can import simulations from many DFT codes "out of the box", here we show how data can be prepared by alternative workflows with machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and sampling from molecular dynamics ensembles.

This site is still under construction: the intent is to provide
- web-based walkthroughs using sphinx/RST
- adaptable command-line scripts for demonstrations

and the scripts should be automatically tested with Github Actions.
